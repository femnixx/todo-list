# todo-list

Simple TODO-list I'm trying to make. In all honesty looking at my friends creating actual applicatiosn and me not being able to do anything makes me so mad at myself. With this, this will be a start to something better. Something larger, than myself. 

I don't want to ruin my own life, not anymore. No more depressive and unproductive episodes. I love my parents and those who I care about, I will not let them down.

Notable features include: 

Task Creation: Allow users to create tasks with titles and descriptions.

Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.

Task Editing: Allow users to edit the title and description of tasks.

Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.

View Tasks: Display a list of tasks (separated by completed and uncompleted).

Just your generic project, but one that I'll do with love and care. Maybe I can publish this and give it to my partner or someone that needs it and maybe can appreciate it... in a way.
